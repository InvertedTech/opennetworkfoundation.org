## We are building unique technologies with ethics as a core tenet.

Open Network Foundation is a 501(c)(3), incorporated in [state_name].

As we move forward into a new digital era, new technologies will be made and adapted to deal with the changing environment, to meet the needs of people who want independence and control. We will be the people to build this technology, along the side of every other person contributing to the network of networks. The Fediverse is a group of networks.

Our team has five managers and a growing development team. We are focused on a multitude of areas, including hardware development, social networking and Fediverse integration, as well as a metaverse application, licensed AGPL3.
